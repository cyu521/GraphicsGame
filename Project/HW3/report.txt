Introduction
Our world have 5 cubes, a grass plane, and a skybox
On mouse click, we toggle an animation on the cubes,
the cubes will be moving up and down.
Then in 5 seconds, one of the cubes will be randomly selected
This cube will change its texture and light.
The user must select the number of the cube that was selected using the keyboard
When the user selected right, the rest of the cubes will be removed
and only show the selected cube for 3 seconds.
The game then restarts.

User Guide
The user have two cameras.
Camera1 (inital camera) - free to move around the world,
z,x,c, to roll, pitch, and yaw.
Arrows to move around freely.
Press A to switch to stationary camera.
Which stays at the inital location where all 5 cubes can be viewed.

To start the game, the user clicks on any object with the mouse
All five cubes will start moving up and down
In 5 seconds, one of the cube will change its texture and lighting.
The user must select the number of the cube that changed its texture.

After selecting the right cube
The rest of the cube will disappear showing only the selected cube

Then in 3 seconds, the rest of the cubes will appear again
Which can restart the game.

Technical/Implementation Details/Notes
Used the skybox, cube, and plane code from previous HW.
Using rand() function to do most of the randomly selecting features
Such as moving up and down, and randomly select the cube for the game
By using vectors, we were able to remove cubes and add cubes back for the disappear and reappear feature.
